# VisualEyes - A virtual room planner!

A virtual room planner inspired by and based off https://github.com/firebase/office-mover-5000

VisualEyes is a web app that lets you visualize furniture/home appliances in your room by uploading a photo and placing/scaling the object on the photo. We used Firebase, Walmart's API and HTML5 canvas to accomplish this.

### This project was built in one weekend at MHacks 6
